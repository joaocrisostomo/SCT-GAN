# Adversarial Smart Contract Framework

This repository hosts the core model and framework developed during my PhD for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts using a Transformer-based GAN architecture. The system is capable of **detecting vulnerabilities**, **generating synthetic and syntactically valid smart contracts**, and **highlighting potential vulnerable regions in code**.

---

## üß† Model Overview

At the heart of this framework lies a custom Transformer-based Generator model designed specifically for smart contracts, integrating:

- Dual input encoding (contract code + execution path),
- A Transformer Encoder-Decoder architecture,
- Position and path-aware token embeddings,
- Sequence generation for synthetic smart contract creation.

The model also outputs high-level **latent representations** for use in a downstream **discriminator** model to complete the GAN architecture.

### üîç Use Cases
- Vulnerability classification and localization in Solidity smart contracts.
- Synthetic smart contract generation for adversarial testing or dataset augmentation.
- Research into adversarial learning for secure smart contract development.
